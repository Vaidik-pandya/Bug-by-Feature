Bug-by-Feature: Logout  -DAY 1

"What to hunt, feature by feature."
Starting today, Iâ€™m dropping a new series for all bug bounty hunters, pentesters, and security learners â€” where we dive into what bugs to hunt on each common web app feature.

"You logged out, but the server didn't get the memo."
Here are 12+ things to test on any logout functionality:

ðŸš¨ Hunt These:
1. Replay intercepted requests after logout 
2. Use old JWT or bearer token post-logout 
3. Use session cookie after logout 
4. Use refresh token to get new access token after logout 
5. Logout on device A â€” check session on device B 
6. WebSocket connection stays active after logout 
7. Back button loads cached authenticated pages 
8. Logout is vulnerable to CSRF 
9. Session fixation (same token/session reused across logins) 
10. Redirect to external site after logout (`next` param abuse) 
11. Sensitive API responses still cached or accessible 
12. Logout doesn't expire refresh token 
13. Cross-tab/session logout not enforced (multi-tab persistence)

âœ… The full checklist of each feature will be maintained on GitHub:

ðŸ“Œ Bookmark it. Save it. Use it as your recon playbook.

ðŸ’­ Before moving to the next featureâ€¦ test this one like a maniac.
This is exactly what we teach on real apps in live bug bounty environments.
